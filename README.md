# üöÄ ETHEREUM PREDICTION MODEL (Python + Docker)

## Project Overview

This project is a simple predictive model designed to forecast the price of **Ethereum (ETH) in US Dollars** over a short-term horizon (7 days).

The model is implemented in **Python** and utilizes the **`Prophet`** library for time series analysis. The entire project is **containerized with Docker** to ensure fast and uniform deployment in any environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Core ML Library:** **Prophet** (developed by Meta) ‚Äî an additive regression model for time series forecasting.
* **Data Collection:** `yfinance` to fetch historical ETH/USD prices.
* **Deployment:** **Docker** ‚Äî for environment isolation and instant startup.

## üß† Model Mechanics

The Prophet model decomposes historical data (using data from the past 2 years) into key components for the forecast:

1.  **Trend:** The long-term direction of the price movement.
2.  **Seasonality:** Regular cyclical patterns (daily, weekly, and yearly cycles).
3.  **Uncertainty:** The output provides not only a point prediction (`yhat`) but also a **95% confidence interval** for risk assessment.
